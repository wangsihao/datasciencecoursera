Previous attempt to write OU noise class:

sim_example.py:	    	     driver script
generate_noise_OU_NEST.py    attempt at a simple attempt (without writing a 
			     proper class: probably npot going to work)
generate_noise_conductances_NEST.py: same


Python version of MATLAB scripts used in 2014 paper:

generate_stim_test.py	    driver script
generate_stim.py	    generate stimulus sequence into cell triplet
generate_noise_conductances.py 	     generate noise sequence (** what we need to 
				     recreate, but using NEST machinery **)
